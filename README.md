1. System Architecture
LangGraph for Task Flow: Define nodes for breaking down tasks, executing scans, and handling failures.
LangChain for AI Processing: Use an LLM to parse high-level security instructions and dynamically adjust the task list.
Security Tools Integration: Wrap nmap, gobuster, ffuf, and sqlmap in Python scripts that return structured output.
Scope Enforcement: Implement a validation layer that checks all tasks against predefined domain/IP rules before execution.
Logging & Reporting: Use structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) and generate session reports.
2. Implementation Plan
Task Execution & Management
Implement a Task Orchestrator that:
Parses instructions (e.g., "Scan google.com for open ports").
Creates a structured workflow (e.g., Step 1: nmap scan → Step 2: Gobuster scan on subdomains).
Monitors execution, retries failures, and updates the task list dynamically.
Security Tool Wrappers
Scope Enforcement
Implement a Scope Manager that:
Validates domain/IP before execution.
Blocks unauthorized scans.
Logs and alerts when violations occur.
Failure Handling & Recovery
Implement Auto-Retry Logic:
If a scan fails, retry with modified parameters.
Example: Switch wordlists in ffuf or adjust scan depth.
3. Additional Features
✅ Unit Tests with Pytest
Test task execution, failure handling, and scope validation.
✅ Streamlit Dashboard
Show:
Live Task List: Running, Pending, Completed, Failed.
Logs & Outputs: Scan results.
